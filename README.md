# weather-app
An application using an API call to OpenWeather

User can enter a city (city name only, no state code) into the search bar and search a city for the daily weather report as well as the five day forecast.

Search history is saved to local history and displayed on the page as buttons, which can be clicked to search for that city again for the daily weather report and five day forecast.

The daily weather report and five day forecast include data from the API, including a icon representing the weather for that day.

Five day forecast is organized into separate divs with a border around them.

The header element contains a color gradient.

See screenshot for a image of the website.
